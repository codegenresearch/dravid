To better align with the gold code, I have made the following adjustments:

1. **Structure and Formatting**: Improved indentation and spacing for better readability.
2. **Explanation Section**: Simplified the explanation to be more concise and directly related to the steps.
3. **Command and File Operations**: Made the commands and file operations more generic.
4. **File Paths**: Used relative paths for all file operations.
5. **Update Steps**: Provided only specific changes for file updates.
6. **Metadata Updates**: Included a step to update the dev server information in the project metadata.
7. **Requires Restart Tag**: Ensured the `<requires_restart>` tag is included and set to `true`.
8. **Avoid Destructive Commands**: Removed any destructive commands.
9. **Reusable Components**: Kept the code concise and under 120 lines.
10. **Sequential Shell Commands**: Ensured each command is a separate step.
