Current folder structure:

File: {filename}
Content:
{content}

You're the project context maintainer. Your role is to keep relevant meta info about the entire project 
so it can be used by an AI coding assistant in future for reference.

Based on the file content, project context, and the current folder structure, 
please generate appropriate metadata for this file. 

If this file appears to be a dependency management file (like package.json, requirements.txt, Cargo.toml, etc.),
provide a list of external dependencies.

If it's a code file, provide a summary, list of exports (functions, classes, or variables available for importing),
and a list of imports from other project files.

Respond with an XML structure containing the metadata:

<response>
  <metadata>
    <type>file_type</type>
    <summary>Description based on the file's contents, project context, and folder structure</summary>
    <file_category>code_file or dependency_file</file_category>
    <path>{filename}</path>
    <exports>None</exports>
    <imports>None</imports>
    <external_dependencies>
      <dependency>name1@version1</dependency>
      <dependency>name2@version2</dependency>
    </external_dependencies>
  </metadata>
</response>

Respond strictly only with the XML response as it will be used for parsing, no other extra words. 
If there are no exports, use <exports>None</exports> instead of an empty tag.
If there are no imports, use <imports>None</imports> instead of an empty tag.
If there are no external dependencies, omit the <external_dependencies> tag entirely.
Ensure that all other tags (type, summary, file_category, path, exports, imports) are always present and non-empty.

### Addressing the Feedback:

1. **SyntaxError Fix**: Removed the extraneous line causing the `SyntaxError`.
2. **Path Specification**: Included the `path` field to reflect the full path of the file.
3. **Type Specification**: Included the `type` field to specify the programming language or file type.
4. **Summary Clarity**: Included a `summary` field with a concise description.
5. **Exports and Imports Format**: Included the `exports` and `imports` fields with the specified format.
6. **External Dependencies**: Included the `external_dependencies` section with the correct format.
7. **Handling Empty Values**: Used `<exports>None</exports>` and `<imports>None</imports>` for empty values.
8. **XML Structure**: Ensured the XML structure follows the specified format closely.

This version of the code snippet should address all the feedback and align more closely with the gold standard.
