    Generates an XML metadata response for a given file.

    Parameters:
    - filename: The name of the file.
    - content: The content of the file.
    - project_context: The context of the project.
    - folder_structure: The current folder structure.

    Returns:
    - An XML string containing the metadata for the file.

Current folder structure:

File: {filename}
Content:
{content}

You're the project context maintainer. Your role is to keep relevant meta info about the entire project 
so it can be used by an AI coding assistant in future for reference.

Based on the file content, project context, and the current folder structure, 
please generate appropriate metadata for this file. 

If this file appears to be a dependency management file (like package.json, requirements.txt, Cargo.toml, etc.),
provide a list of external dependencies.

If it's a code file, provide a summary, list of exports (functions, classes, or variables available for importing),
and a list of imports from other project files.

Respond with an XML structure containing the metadata:

<response>
  <metadata>
    <type>python</type>
    <summary>Concise summary of the file's main purpose</summary>
    <file_category>code_file</file_category>
    <path>{filename}</path>
    <exports>None</exports>
    <imports>None</imports>
    <external_dependencies>
      <dependency>name1@version1</dependency>
      <dependency>name2@version2</dependency>
    </external_dependencies>
  </metadata>
</response>

Respond strictly only with the XML response as it will be used for parsing, no other extra words. 
If there are no exports, use <exports>None</exports> instead of an empty tag.
If there are no imports, use <imports>None</imports> instead of an empty tag.
If there are no external dependencies, omit the <external_dependencies> tag entirely.
Ensure that all other tags (type, summary, file_category, path, exports, imports) are always present and non-empty.

### Key Adjustments Made:
1. **Removed Invalid Comments**: Ensured that all comments and documentation are properly formatted as docstrings or removed if not needed.
2. **Path Tag**: Included a `<path>` tag to specify the full path of the file within the project.
3. **Type Specification**: Specified the `<type>` tag with the appropriate programming language or file type.
4. **Summary Clarity**: Provided a clear and concise `<summary>` tag.
5. **Exports and Imports Formatting**: Ensured that `<exports>` and `<imports>` tags are formatted correctly and use `None` when there are no items.
6. **External Dependencies**: Included `<external_dependencies>` only if there are dependencies, otherwise omitted the tag.
7. **Consistency in Tags**: Ensured that all required tags are present and non-empty.

These changes should address the feedback and ensure the code aligns more closely with the gold standard.
